General Patton once said, "The measure of a person's success is not by standing at the peak, but by the rebound force after falling from the peak." Chu Shijian's life was like this: he became wealthy in middle age, gained both fame and fortune, and then fell to the bottom again. He started his own business at the age of 74, returned with Chu Cheng 10 years later, and made a comeback with billions of wealth. His development trajectory was a process of rebound.

## Early stories
### Starting from

In the spring of 2014, at the border of Huaning County and Yiliang County in Yunnan Province, a small mountain village called Yize had an old courtyard house with a history of over a hundred years demolished. The village committee is leading the villagers in the construction of a "beautiful countryside". In one year, the old village houses will no longer be visible, replaced by new reinforced concrete residential buildings. Just like the transformation of Chinese cities 10 or 20 years ago, this small village surrounded by mountains has also begun to fall into the "construction site mode".

#### Childhood waves

Almost all children who grow up by the river have an undeniable talent: good at water. Chu Shijian is no exception. Not only has he developed excellent swimming skills in the Nanpan River and flower ponds since childhood, but at the age of five or six, he can already dive far with a fierce spear. Moreover, he has been able to catch fish in the ponds on the Nanpan River and riverbanks since the age of seven or eight.

### Youth stories

Chu Shijian's more than ten years of living freely in the countryside were actually more than ten years of turbulent Chinese society. Especially after the Lugou Bridge Incident in 1937, the Japanese launched a full-scale invasion of China, and in just two or three years, most of China's territory fell one after another

## Ten Years of Passionate Youth
### Becoming a guerrilla fighter

In the summer of 1948, Chu Shijian returned to his hometown and became a teacher at Lufeng Railway Station Primary School. At the same time, he continued to maintain contact with the Communist Party organization with Chu Shiren and Chu Shijie, and did some work of transmitting intelligence

#### War is raging

Due to the significant disparity in combat effectiveness, guerrilla forces can only rely on exchanging one shot for another, specifically targeting weak areas of the enemy to attack, but more often than not, they are defending and shifting positions.

### Embrace liberation

In December 1949, Lu Han, the Chairman of the Nationalist Party in Yunnan Province, announced an uprising in Kunming, marking the official beginning of Yunnan's liberation. On February 20, 1950, Chen Gong, Song Renqiong, and Zhou Baozhong led the Fourth Corps of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army into Kunming. On February 24, Chen Gong declared the liberation of the entire Yunnan province.

## The discontinuity of life
### Falling into the bottom of life

The people who were overthrown in the "anti rightist" movement had only one way to go after their "rightist" identity was determined: to be demoted to the farm. A farm is truly a place for farming, where one must live the same life as a farmer.

## Conclusion
### Time is like a river

In 2015, it was the 60th anniversary of Chu Shijian and Ma Jingfen's marriage, known as the commemorative year of the "diamond wedding". This is simply a reward in life. With the increasing divorce rate in China, a 60 year marriage is almost like a dream from a past life. With the companionship of a child, Chu Shijian and Ma Jingfen have experienced various storms of the country and individuals, and faced life and death together. They are not only husband and wife, but also a pair of comrades in arms. Although Ma Jingfen occasionally complains about Chu Shijian's carelessness when he was young, in the end, she would say, "Without me, there would be no him, and without him, there would be no me

## Author thanks

This book started interviewing in early summer 2014 and has been completed today, taking 18 months. The 'author' on the cover can only be my name, but only I know that this book contains the hearts and minds of too many people. Of course, I would like to first thank Mr. Wang Shi. Without him, there would be no book. Upon careful consideration, I realize that without Mr. Wang Shi's constant urging and encouragement, and without my writing work today. Since I started working as a professional writer in 2006, he has created many opportunities for me to write and has generously shared his life and learning experiences and insights with me. Thank you very much for your kindness.

Finally, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to Mr. Chu Shijian. Not only because he was generous and candid in facing my various questions, but more importantly, in the process of listening to his story, his prosperous life experience, strong vitality, and his pure heart towards life and career also enriched my thinking about my own life.
